# Data Science Kata

These are a collection of notebooks with kata-style exercises on most popular packages and libararies used in machine learning and data science.

The objective is to speed up the on boarding of the new members to a data science team. In a way, just like gettin a driver's license ensures that the licensee has the minimum knowledge and skills to drive a vehicle, going through this katas will provide all members with working knowledge of the package in question.

The Katas start easy and gain complexity as we move forward. Therefore, they can also act as a refresher for topics with less frequency, or a template for some actions that the engineer may not immediately remember.
